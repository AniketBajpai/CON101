A)
	Cross validation is a model validation technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.
In this exercise, as we had limited data, it made sense to use 5-fold cross validation, as it gives a lower variance than conventional validation. It will also help in checking overfitting. 
As there were only 5 files, cross validation was performed by manually changing the names of the 4 training and 1 test file.
Results of 5-fold cross validation -
1. Training files : 1,2,3,4
   Test file : 5
   Accuracy : 94.88 %
2. Training files : 1,2,3,5
   Test file : 4
   Accuracy : 94.88 %
3. Training files : 1,2,4,5
   Test file : 3
   Accuracy : 95.64 %
4. Training files : 1,3,4,5
   Test file : 2
   Accuracy : 94.88 %
5. Training files : 2,3,4,5
   Test file : 1
   Accuracy : 97.92 % 
   
Avg. accuracy = 95.62 %

B)
Accuracy in random prediction = 12.62 %

C)
Impovement over random predicton = 83.00 %
